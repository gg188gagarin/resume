                beautiful
                it is. About the sunset they saw. About how the sun, sinking into the waves, became scarlet like blood,
                and felt that the sea absorbed the energy of the luminary into itself, and the sun was tamed, and the
                fire
                was already burning out in the depths. And you. What will you tell them.You have never been to the sea.
